    "Since 2008, statistician Nate Silver's website, **<font color=#2E5266>fivethirtyeight.com</font>** has garnered praise for on a wide variety of topics in current politics and political news. Both the website and founder are most famous for correctly predicting election results -- most significantly the 2012 election in which fivethirtyeight (538) correctly predicted the US election outcome for all 50 sates and the District of Columbia. The same statistical model predicted Hillary Clinton as the winner of the 2016 US Presidential election, however we all know this to not be the reality. So what happened exactly? This notebook will explore the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How did FiveThirtyEight make its predictions?\n",
    "- Was the FiveThirtyEight prediction incorrect due to statistical error, systematic error, or both?\n",
    "- Should we say that FiveThirtyEight and other major election analysts \"failed\"?\n",

    ">**<font color = #6E8898>Systematic error</font>** is is consistent, repeatable error associated with faulty equipment or a flawed experiment design while **<font color = #6E8898>statistical error</font>** is the unknown difference between a calculated value and the true value.\n",

In the latter article, Pew Research had the following to say:\n",
    "> The results of Tuesday’s presidential election came as a surprise to nearly everyone who had been following the national and state election polling, which consistently projected Hillary Clinton as defeating Donald Trump. Relying largely on opinion polls, election forecasters put Clinton’s chance of winning at anywhere from 70% to as high as 99%"

    ">A decade ago, it was fairly easy to tell the difference between a good poll and a bad poll. Most pollsters assumed that high-quality survey research required a high-quality survey design: a so-called probability sample, meaning that everyone in the public had an equal chance of being included in a poll. A poll was either a good probability sample (from random dialing of telephone numbers, for example) or it was not (like an online poll).\n",

This is why taking a sample *representative* of the general population is so important. A sampling method is called **biased** if it systematically favors some outcomes over others. Bias can be intentional, but often it is not.\n",

One of the main solutions in data science for such a problem is known as bootstrapping! **Bootstrapping** is a computer-based method for statistical inference that resamples from data to estimate statistics on a population by sampling with replacement. It can be used to estimate a mean, standard deviation, or in this case -- a proportion!\n",

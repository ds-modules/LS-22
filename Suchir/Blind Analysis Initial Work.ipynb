Every decision made today, whether it be deciding prices on a McDonalds menu or predicting the winner of an election, is increasingly relying on drawing conclusions from data.

A responsible approach would be to initially agree on a methodology, and run the experiment without \"peeking\" at the raw data. Only when the analysis is finished should we examine our result. This approach is called \"blind analysis,\" and we will investigate how it works and why it's so important!"

## **Notebook 1: Statistical + Systematic Uncertainty**
*This notebook utilizes polling data to show the differences between systematic and statistical uncertainties and recreates 538's election model.*<br>
### LEARNING GOALS
* Be aware that every measurement comes with some degree of uncertainty.
* Understand the difference between statistical uncertainty/error and systematic uncertainty/error.
### CONCEPT APPLICATION
* Identify sources of measurement uncertainty/error that introduce statistical uncertainty/error, that introduce systematic uncertainty/error, and that introduce both.
* Suggest approaches to reducing or constraining measurement uncertainty (both statistical and systematic).

**Notebook 2: Error Types**
*This notebook explores the difference between a false positive error and a false negative error. We create a KNN model to classify spam/ham emails and test it's accuracy.*
### LEARNING GOALS
* Given some degree of uncertainty, appreciate that different kinds of errors come with different costs, such that in some cases it is worthwhile to presume the less likely alternative because the error you risk is less costly. 
* Understand the difference between the two types of errors and realize that there are trade offs to trying to minimize one of them.
### CONCEPT APPLICATION
* Identify false positive (type I) and false negative (type II) errors in scientific and everyday situations.      
* Weigh the costs associated with false positives/negatives with the benefits associated with true positives/negatives when making a decision under uncertain conditions.          
* Explain how people could come to different decisions or policies as a result of different utilities/values associated with different types of errors, even if they agree about the relevant facts.

    "\"The idea that digital devices and the Internet have an enduring influence on how humans develop, socialize and thrive is a compelling one1. As the time spent by young people online has doubled in the past decade2, the debate about whether this shift negatively impacts children and adolescents is becoming increasingly heated3. A number of professional and governmental organizations have therefore called for more research into digital screen-time4,5, which has led to household panel surveys6,7 and large-scale social datasets adding measures of digital technology use to those already assessing psychological well-being8. Unfortunately, findings derived from the cross-sectional analysis of these datasets are conflicting; in some cases negative associations between digital technology use and well-being are found9,10, often receiving much attention even when correlations are small. Yet other results are mixed11 or contest previously discovered negative effects when re-analysing identical data12. One high-quality, pre-registered analysis of UK adolescents found that moderate digital engagement does not correlate with well-being, but very high levels of usage possibly have small negative associations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "All datasets contained a wide range of different questions that concern adolescents’ psychological well-being and functioning. We reversed selected measures so that these are all in the same direction, with higher scores indicating higher well-being."

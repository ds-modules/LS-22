Currently, the `my_text.txt` file is empty, and running the code below will not yeild any meaningful results.\n",

It could be an essay/paper you recently wrote (to maybe see if there are any secret messages that you might be unintentionally writing), or any text that you find online. We do not have access/will not be reading what you put as your own text, this is for your own curiosity. You man want to consider browsing https://www.gutenberg.org/ for any free works of literature to try out; all of the works that we used in our examples came gutenberg.org, so consider checking it out!"
